- Auto-post insurance payments to patient ledger.
- Handle partial payments and remainders. 

### ❌ 7. Denials & Appeals
- Classify denials using NLP on Explanation of Benefits.
- Generate appeal letters with supporting documentation.
- Resubmit appeals with tracking.

### 🧠 8. AI Assist
- NLP-based CDT prediction.
